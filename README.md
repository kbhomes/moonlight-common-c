# Moonlight Streaming Core Library

This is the forked version of Moonlight-common-c for [Moonlight Embedded](https://github.com/irtimmer/moonlight-embedded).

Moonlight-common-c contains the core GameStream client code shared between [Moonlight](http://moonlight-stream.com) clients, including 
[Moonlight PC](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt), [Moonlight Android](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android),
[Moonlight iOS](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios), and [Moonlight Chrome](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-chrome).

If you are implementing your own Moonlight game streaming client that can use a C library, you probably want the code here.
